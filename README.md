Hi, this is Sunny 
This is a mini game for my javacript basic course in Langara College, Vancouver

Here is the basic rules: 
1. Only after pressing 5 keys can the execute button be clicked to control the fish movement
2. While the sealion is the enemy, it's movement is random and not predictable
3. Obtaining rainbow could the fish to obtain superpower for a couples rounds, which allows it to become 'Mad Fish' and invulnerable to the enemy
4. The goal is to eat as many green worms as possible
